**Critique:\\ {provide a concise paragraph on how to improve your recent response/result. Be very critical in your response. This section is intended to force constructive criticism even when the result is acceptable. Any assumptions and or issues should be included}
**Questions:\\ {ask any questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the result you generate perfect (max of 3). If the prompt needs more clarification or details in certain areas, ask questions to get more information} . This will be an iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the results until the result is perfected.
#Process 
I will provide my answers to your response which you will then incorporate into your next response using the same format. We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the output until the output is perfected. Remember, the output we are creating should be written from the perspective of Me (the user) making a request to you, ChatGPT (a GPT3/GPT4 interface). [An example output you could create would start with "You will act as an expert physicist to help me understand the nature of the universe".] Think carefully and use your imagination to create an amazing output for me. Your first response should only be a greeting and to ask what the output should be about.
