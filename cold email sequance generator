#Cold email context and info
Part 3 - Writing Cold Emails✍️
● Cold Friendly Offers
○ It doesn’t matter how good your cold email is if you don’t have what I call a
cold friendly offer.
■ A cold friendly offer is an offer that is compelling enough to get the
attention of a complete cold stranger while they are mindlessly
scrolling through their email inbox filled with hundreds of other offers.
○ Examples of cold friendly offers:
■ Real Estate Agents: Get 10 Listing Appointments Or You Don’t Pay
■ Remodelers: Get 2 New Bathroom Remodels Every Month or You
Don’t Pay
■ Mortgage Officers: Get 20 Approved Loan Applications Or You Don’t
Pay
Roofers: Get 16 New Roofing Replacements Per Month Or You Don’t Pay
Agency Owners: Get 90 Qualified Sales Calls Per Month Or You Don’t Pay
You need to understand that with cold email you are sending messages to COLD
STRANGERS, you need an offer that will make you immediately stand out without needing
to say much to get the highest percentage of them on a call with you.
There’s three steps to creating a cold friendly offer:
● Step 1) Specific Avatar
○ You NEED to create an offer for a SPECIFIC person. Just saying that you
help real estate professionals isn’t specific enough for cold traffic.
■ You need to choose from Real Estate Agents, Loan Officers,
Wholesalers, or Investors.
■ However, don’t get TOO specific or it will backfire. The key is that the
offer resonates with the exact person you are cold emailing.
● Step 2) Specific Outcome
○ You NEED to choose the outcome that the market desires the most.
■ Most people in the real estate niche have slow growth due to
guaranteeing leads or appointments instead of offering the specific
outcome the market desires the most, which is more listing
appointments.
■ Buyers vs Sellers
■ Estate AI, Meskula Media, Regain Media all guarantee 10
listing appointments
■ Another example is remodelers, they specifically prefer bathroom
projects as they are faster to complete and less of a headache than
kitchen projects.
■ You need to do market research and figure out the exact outcome that
the market desires the most in order for your offer to have the highest
conversions on cold traffic.
● Step 3) Risk Reversal
○ You NEED a risk reversal in order for your cold email to get the highest
number of meetings.
○ Most people fail to understand that a risk reversal or guarantee is used at the
marketing level but not the sales level.
■ By the time most prospects get on the call they won’t even mention
the guarantee or risk reversal but without it they would have never
responded to your cold email and
● certainly would have never agreed to get on the call in the first place.
● A risk reversal can be:
○ A Money Back Guarantee (Highest Converting)
■ This only works with conditions
○ Or We Work For Free
■ This is good, but in the cold email you want to still use the word
“Guaranteed”
○ 30 Day Satisfaction Guarantee
■ If by the end of the first 30 days the client doesn’t feel like you’re the
team to get them to the specific outcome, they get a refund.
● A money back guarantee is always gonna be the highest converting risk reversal as
being able to say “Or You Don’t Pay” helps you immediately stand out.
○ What most of the top guys do is create a money back guarantee to use at the
marketing level but on the backend it has conditions in order for the prospect
to even apply for it.
○ For example these conditions may include:
■ $20-50/day minimum ad spend
■ Contact All Leads in 48 Hours
■ Respond To Our Team in 72 Hours
■ Consume All Required Training Content
■ Update CRM every 48 hours
■ Etc.
○ The idea is that you choose conditions that make it unreasonable that the
prospect doesn’t achieve the desired outcome.
● This allows you to use the extremely powerful guarantee in your cold email without
taking on much extra risk on your end.
● The truth is some prospects won’t even be able to apply for the guarantee but they
would have never got on the sales call without it.
○ This may sound unethical to some people but it’s what all the top guys are
doing so if you want to compete at that level I’d recommend doing the same.
○ I’ve never seen a prospect get mad about this, again most of them will forget
about the guarantee by the time they get
● on the call but in the worst case scenario you just downsell them on a different
guarantee.
● Again, the guarantee is used at the marketing level in your cold email to 5-10x the
amount of meetings you book, but then you should rely on your sales process to
convert them on the call.
○ If they ask about the guarantee on the call just say something along the lines
of “Yeah, so we guarantee the 10 listing appointments as long as you invest
the minimum ad spend and do all of the work on your end.”
Subject Lines
● After you’ve created your cold friendly offer you can start writing your cold emails.
● The first step is your subject lines.
○ The main goal of the subject line is to pique the prospect’s curiosity and get
them to open the email.
○ However, remember this is cold email and not email marketing so don’t do
anything salesy or how you would market to your email list.
○ I try to mimic internal emails that are sent within the organization or company
when creating subject lines.
■ The less formal, the better.
■ Avoid using capitalization
○ A good rule of thumb is to start with the subject line “quick question” and use
the open rate as a baseline to test other subject lines down the road.
○ You can also test using personalized variables in your subject lines.
■ Examples of top performing subject lines:
■ quick question
■ {{firstName}} - quick question
■ {{firstName}}, thoughts?
■ question for {{firstName}}
■ question about {{companyName}}
■ {{firstName}}?
■ Again, don’t overthink this step, just start with “quick question” to get a
baseline open rate that you can test against later down the road.
■ If the leads are from Outscraper then use “question about
{{companyName}}” or quick question
Anatomy of A Cold Email
● I typically write 3-4 line cold emails that are relevant, fit on an iPhone screen (70% of
emails are opened on mobile), and straight to the point.
● These emails are broken into the sections shown below:
1. The Opener
● The Body
● (optional) A Case Study
● The Call To Action
● Signature
● I will break down how to write all 5 sections and then how to put them all together.
Writing The Opener
● Cold email openers are the first sentence in the cold email and also act as a second
subject line.
● A good opener should convey to the prospect that the email was written just for them,
even if it really wasn’t.
● Try to make it as relevant as possible to the prospect who’s going to be reading it as
relevance is the key to good cold emails.
○ Top Performing Cold Email Openers:
■ I came across you while searching for realtors in Miami.
■ As a real estate agent in Miami, I imagine you’re always looking for
ways to generate more seller opportunities.
We want to show them in as little words as possible, exactly why they should respond to our
cold email.
The best body will always be presenting your cold friendly offer and positioning it in a way
that makes the prospect want to learn more about how it works, eliciting a response.
● Again, having a risk reversal will 10x your results.
Make sure your offer is easily quantifiable, a specific result in a specific time frame.
Understand your current market’s level of sophistication and awareness, if needed you may
need to position your mechanism as unique and avoid overused keywords.
● If your market is constantly hearing ‘Facebook Ads’, avoid using keywords related to
Facebook ads and create your own unique mechanism.
○ You can learn more about this by reading about Eugene Schwartz’s levels of
market sophistication.
○ For example, instead of saying “Our Facebook Ads will bring you 10 listing
appointments or you don’t pay”, you can say:
■ We have a way to bring you 10 listing appointments using our seller
attraction system - or you don’t pay!
■ We have a way to bring you 10 listing appointments through our
Youtube Ads system - or you don’t pay!
I’ve found that using specific numbers can make your offer seem more realistic and easier to
comprehend to the prospect.
● For example, we had a campaign where we said “7 listing appointments” instead of
10.
● Or another campaign where we said “52 in-home appointments” instead of 50.
○ This comes from the book “Scientific Advertising,” using specific numbers
makes the claim more believable and easier to comprehend.
○ Most people use common numbers to describe their offer like 5, 10, 20, etc.
○ Being oddly specific adds a level of realism to the claim, like it’s from a
specific real-life example or case study, even if it’s not.
Simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication…
● Top Performing Body Examples
○ We can get 57 paid trials to come into your gym for a workout next month
using our end-to-end lead nurturing process - or you don’t pay.
■ Was searching for the top auto detailers in Northridge and came
across Endless Summer Detailing - congrats on the 5 star rating!
■ Was searching for the top lawn care companies in Boston and came
across TrueGreen’s website - you guys have some great reviews!
■ Was searching for gyms here in San Diego and came across Planet
Fitness.
■ Noticed you play a major role in Remodeling Pro’s marketing efforts - I
imagine you’re always looking for ways to maximize the budget.
■ As a fellow agency owner, I imagine you’re always looking for more
ways to fill up your calendar with more sales calls.
■ As the founder of a SaaS company, I imagine you’re always looking
for ways to hire experienced SDRs.
■ Was searching for top solar companies in Kingman and came across
SolLife - keep up the great work!
■ Was scrolling through Facebook and came across one of
{{companyName}}’s ads.
Writing The Body
● After the prospect reads the opener we want to give them context on exactly what we
can do for THEM.
● We help agents like yourself get an extra 7 listing appointments every 5 months
guaranteed.
● We have a way to bring you 16 solar installs over the next 30 days - or you don’t pay.
● We can help you sell 20 more used cars each month using our car dealership
accelerator system - or you don’t pay.
● We can book 15 meetings on your sales rep’s calendar each month - and you only
pay per booked meeting that shows.
● We have a way to bring you 10 listing appointments over the next 6 months,
guaranteed.
● We can bring you 2 bathroom remodeling projects over the next 30 days - or you
don’t pay.
Writing The CTA
● The CTA is the last line of the cold email and should give the prospect a clear next
step as to what they have to do to learn more about the offer you presented in the
body.
● The best CTAs are often soft and conversational, avoiding sounding corporate or
overly professional.
● Always make sure the CTA is a question that can easily be answered and is
“low-risk” to the prospect.
○ For example, if you’re asking the prospect to meet on a 45-minute Zoom call,
that is “high-risk” for the prospect.
2. That’s 45-minutes of time they may never get back and a Zoom call is
a bigger commitment than a phone call.
3. So a “lower-risk” CTA would be asking for permission to send more
info or to have a quick 5-min chat.
● Don’t make the prospect feel pressured to book a call, even with a cold friendly offer,
you’re still a complete stranger who emailed them.
● Always make sure that the CTA flows with the opener and the body, I’d recommend
reading it aloud to yourself.
○ Send the email to your inbox and open it, put yourself in the prospect's shoes,
does the email make sense?
● One of my favorite CTAs is just “Mind if I send more info?” because it’s extremely
low-risk and gets a high throughput of interested leads.
● Using a soft CTA will allow you to test the cold email angle/offer faster and get better
results if you’re in a saturated market.
● It’s important to understand there’s three types of CTAs:
2. Hard CTA - goes straight for the meeting
3. Soft CTA - asks for permission to send more info
● Value CTA - asks for permission to share something of value such as a video or sales
asset
● Hard CTA Examples:
○ Are you interested in learning more?
○ Are you open to learning more?
○ Do you have 12 minutes for a call this week?
○ Are you open to a quick call to discuss this further?
○ Would it make sense if we meet sometime this week to talk this through?
○ Any interest in connecting on a call to learn more?
○ Any interest in hearing how the system works?
○ Open to discussing how we can do the same for you?
○ Open to exploring this further?
○ How does Monday suit you for a quick chat?
○ Is this worth exploring for {{companyName}}?
● Soft CTA Examples:
○ Mind if I send more info?
○ Mind if I share more info about how this works?
○ Do you mind if I send more information on this?
○ Would you like more info before we put something on the calendar?
● Value CTA Examples:
○ Would you like to see a quick video explaining further?
○ Mind if I send a quick video explaining the system?
○ Mind if I send a quick Loom on this?
○ Mind if I send a quick video explaining how we can implement this for
{{companyName}}?
○ I made a Google Doc on how we implement this, cool if I share it?
○ I made a resource on this, mind if I share it with you?
Adding A Signature
● Without a signature it’s hard for the prospect to trust you based on a random cold
email.
● Having an optimized signature shows that you’re a real person and that they could
Google you and your company if they wanted.
● Adding a phone number to your signature will also occasionally result in interested
leads who skip responding to the cold email and call you.
● You can also add a link to your calendar in the signature for interested prospects who
don’t wanna waste time going back and forth over email.
● If you have a small following on YouTube, LinkedIn, or Instagram you can link it in
your signature to increase your credibility and authority.
● Adding a business address/phone number also tells Google and the prospect that
you are likely a real person and not a scammer.
○ Signature Framework
■ [Full Name]
■ [Role] | [Company Name]
■ [Let's Chat]
■ [Phone Number]
■ [City & Zip Code]
■ [Youtube or LinkedIn]
○ Example:
■ Jackson Williams
Founder | Lead Odyssey
Let’s Chat
(818) 566-8712
Northridge, 91324
Let’s Connect On LinkedIn!Adding Case Studies
● Adding case studies to your cold email is an easy way to separate yourself from the
competition and increase the booking rate.
○ If you have them, I 100% recommend using them in some part of your cold
email sequence.
● You can either put the case study as the body, after the body, in the P.S. section, or
use it in one of your follow-ups.
● There’s really no best place to put it, as long as you include it.
● Make sure to use a relevant case study that flows with the rest of the cold email.
○ It shouldn't be from a different avatar than the cold email is targeting.
● Make sure the case study is tangible and includes a specific end result, something
that the prospect can easily visualize and understand.
○ Case Study Example #1 - The Body
■ In this example, you essentially just use a relevant case study as the
body of the cold email.
■ Hey {{firstName}},
I came across you while searching for realtors in Miami.
Just reaching out because our listing accelerator system
recently helped Mario Avalos, a local Realtor in Miami, close 7
new listings in the first 20 weeks of working with us.
Open to learning how we can help you do the same?
● Case Study Example #2 - After The Body (3rd Line)
○ In this example you essentially just insert the case study after the body and
before the call to action, giving you a cold email without about 4 lines.
■ Hey {{firstName}},
Was searching for top solar companies in Kingman and came across
SolLife - keep up the great work!
We have a way to bring you 16 solar installs over the next 30 days - or
you don’t pay.
Recently, we helped Solar Optimum in Jacksonville add $100K worth
of solar deals to their pipeline in the first 14 days of working with us.
Are you interested in learning more?
● Case Study Example #3 - The Follow Up
○ In this example you essentially just use the case study in one of your
follow-up emails, the email below is email #2 in the sequence.
■ The reason I reached out a few days ago is because we’ve been
helping agency owners book more sales calls by leveraging new A.I.
tech.
We recently helped EstateAdvertising, a marketing agency that
specializes in real estate, book 28 qualified sales calls in the first 30
days of working with us.
Are you open to hearing some ideas I had to help you do the same?
Putting It All Together
● At this point you should know how to write the opener, the body, the CTA, signature,
and how to add case studies if you have them.
● Now I’ll show you how to put all these pieces together and make sure they flow.
● The biggest thing is making sure the ENTIRE cold email is relevant from the opener
to the call to action.
○ Read the entire cold email aloud and make sure it not only flows but
maintains relevance.
● Here’s some real-life winning cold email examples:
○ Example #1 - Real Estate Niche
■ Hey {{firstName}}
As a real estate agent, I imagine you’re always looking for ways to get
more listing opportunities.
We have a way to bring you 7 listing appointments over the next few
months and if it doesn’t work - you don’t pay.
One of our clients, John Doe, a residential agent in Miami, added an
extra $237k worth of GCI in his first year working with us.
Mind if I send more Info?
Kind Regards,
{{signature}}
○ Example #2 - Home Improvement Niche
■ Hey {{firstname}},
I came across {{companyName}} while searching for top rated
contractors in {{city}} - I take it you’re always looking for ways to get
more contracts?
We have a way to bring you 2 bathroom remodels over the next 30
days - or you don’t pay.
Mind if I send more info?
Kind Regards,
{{signature}}
● Example #3 - Home Improvement Niche (Marketing Dept.)
○ Hey {{firstName}},
I noticed you play a major role in {{companyName}}’s marketing efforts - I
imagine you’re always looking for ways to maximize the budget.
We have a way to bring you 52 in-home appointments with homeowners
actively looking to remodel over the next 20 weeks.
Any interest in connecting on a quick 5-min call to learn more?
Speak Soon,
{{signature}}
● Example #4 - Solar Niche
○ Hey {{firstName}},
Came across {{companyName}} while searching for solar companies in
{{city}}.
We have a way to bring you 16 solar installations over the next 30 days - or
you don’t pay.
Mind if I send more info?
Kind Regards,
{{signature}}
● Example #5 - Agency Owners Niche
○ Hey {{firstName}},
As a fellow agency owner, I imagine you’re always looking for ways to fill your sales team’s
calendar.
If we could generate you 17 qualified appointments in the next 30 days on a performance
basis, like we just did for EstateAdvertising, would you be open to learning more?
Kind Regards,
{{signature}}
Experimentation
● The simple cold email framework I just taught you works, it’s easy to follow, and will
get meetings coming in the door.
○ However, don’t be afraid to branch out and try your own things after you get
the ball rolling.
■ As long as your cold emails have a no-brainer offer and are short,
concise, relevant, and straight to the point, you can test different ways
of writing them.
■ Also, try and keep every email below 280 characters or 50 words and
remember the majority of readers will be on Mobile.
■ And never talk about yourself more than you talk about the prospect.
■ Keep a 2:1 ratio, you should be speaking about the prospect
2x as much as you speak about yourself.
● As long as you follow these basic rules I would strongly recommend experimenting
and trying new angles and ways of formatting your cold emails.
● For example, the following 1-sentence cold email added six figures of MRR for one of
our clients.
○ Apologies if this is too upfront, but we have a way to bring you more work for
your home improvement company.
Mind if I send more?
Kind Regards,
{{signature}}
● It’s different from the framework above, but it follows most of the basic rules.
Sales Assets
● If you’re in an extremely saturated niche you can also try just offering a sales asset or
video in your cold email using a value-based CTA.
○ Most of the people I know in the ecommerce niche offer some type of sales
asset in order to make cold email work in such a saturated niche.
○ Then when a prospect responds you just send them the sales asset and
include a CTA in the response when you send it to them.
■ You can also include an option to book a call inside of the actual sales
asset.
○ This allows you to stand out in the prospect’s inbox, get a higher throughput
of positive responses, and provide value upfront.
○ A sales asset can be a case study, SOP, or process documented inside of a
Google Doc or Gamma Project that will be of extreme value to your ICP.
○ It can also be a free training or case study breakdown video hosted on a
landing page with a book a call button.
● Examples of using a sales asset in your cold email:
○ Hey {{firstName}} - we just helped ABCMarketing book 17 qualified sales calls
in the first 30 days of working with us and I documented the entire process we
used from A-Z.
Mind if I send it over so you can use the same process at {{companyName}}?
● Hey {{firstName}},
Just came across {{companyName}}’s ad on Facebook - wanted to reach out.
Recently we partnered with GymShark to 2x their email marketing revenue in 37
days by adding our plug-n-play flows.
Mind if I send over the flows so you can do the same at {{companyName}}?
● Hey {{firstName}},
I just put together a list of 2,000 leads that could be your ideal client.
Mind if I send it over?
Follow Up Sequences
● After writing your initial cold email, the next step is to write your follow-up sequence.
○ The beautiful thing about cold email automation is that we can also automate
a follow-up sequence of additional emails for when the prospect doesn’t
respond to the initial cold email.
○ The best follow-up sequences flow together and remain relevant to the first
cold email (for the most part).
■ I typically send each lead a total of 5 emails until they respond, so the
initial cold email plus 4 additional follow-ups.
■ This allows you to get the most squeeze out of the lemon.
■ Keep in mind that an alternative strategy is to only send 2
emails per every lead, get better deliverability, and focus on
VOLUME/contacting more leads per month.
■ This can work if you have a very large TAM.
● Always split test each of your follow-ups the same way you would test multiple cold
emails.
● If you have a case study and haven’t used it in your cold email yet, a great place to
put it is in your follow-ups.
● It’s okay to use Call-To-Actions in some of your follow-ups.
● If you have sales assets, you can offer to send them in your later follow-ups.
○ This may catch the attention of new prospects who have been ignoring your
sequence up until that point.
● Never send a break-up email that willingly cuts off communication with a prospect.
○ Instead, you can send what's called a “Pass Off Email” and ask them if there’s
anyone else at the company you should reach out to.
● My secret weapon is having a 5th email sent at least 17 days from the 4th email and
framing it as a new email.
○ A big part of cold emailing is timing, so if they ignore your first 4 emails, it’s
best to wait over two weeks before sending the 5th and final email in the
sequence.

Spintax
Spintax is NOT optional, you actually NEED it.
Your deliverability will TANK after a few months if you don’t start using it.
When you start sending hundreds of the same exact emails every day, the ESPs quickly
catch on and start sending your emails to spam.
Spintax allows you to randomize words and sentences in your cold emails and stay
under the radar while sending hundreds of cold emails every day.
You can leverage ChatGPT to easily add Spintax to your cold emails.
You can also use something similar known as liquid syntax to randomize text in your
emails based on certain times and days of the week.
This makes your emails appear more personalized and has the same effect as regular
spintax, making each of your emails different.
In order to implement liquid syntax, check your sending software's resources for a guide
on how to do it on the platform (Instafly or SmartLead).
An easy way to make every email unique is to add a spintax with 3-5 inspiration quotes
under your signature.
This will create so many random variations of your cold emails without looking out of
place since lots of people add quotes under their signatures.
Syntax Formula
{{RANDOM | Variation #1 | Variation #2 | Variation #3}}
Example: {{RANDOM | Hey | Hi | Hello}}
This is the format Instantly uses. SmartLeads may be slightly different, so always
check your sending software's format.
Example Of Syntax In A Cold Email:
{{RANDOM | Hey | Hi}} {{firstName}},
{{RANDOM | Came | Stumbled}} across {{companyName}} while {{RANDOM | looking |
searching}} for solar companies in {{city}}.
We have a way to bring you 16 solar {{RANDOM | installations | installs}} over the next
30 days - or you don’t pay.
Mind if I {{RANDOM | share | send}} more info?
{{RANDOM | Kind Regards, | Best, | Speak Soon,}}
{{signature}}
{{RANDOM | Insert Quote #1 | Insert Quote #2 | Insert Quote #3 | Insert Quote #4 | Insert

as.
